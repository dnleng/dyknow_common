DyKnow Common
=============

The DyKnow Common repository contains the following components used for DyKnow-ROS:
- The DyKnow Proxy for run-time reconfiguration of nodelets.
- Functionality for measuring computation unit performance.

While this is not the full DyKnow-ROS code-base, I hope parts like the run-time reconfiguration services may be useful to others.
Please see [my dissertation](http://dx.doi.org/10.3384/diss.diva-157633) for further details.
